## ScreepsOCS/screeps.code.extension

This is the OCS screeps AI extension repo, formerly known as *screeps.ocs.internal*. 

This is not a standalone screeps AI, but extends the [main AI repo](https://github.com/ScreepsOCS/screeps.code).

You may want to use the [package repo](https://github.com/ScreepsOCS/screeps.code.package) for merging both repos plus your custom overrides and additions. It also offers screeps deployment and some advanced functionalities.
